# CS-255

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well?

We listened to the requirements of the DriverPass staff, and created the design for a system that will allow customers to schedule drivers training services and take other actions that will allow them to be ready to take their DMV driving exam. I translated the client interview into a set of system requirements well which allowed for a great end design.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could revise work on this poroject, I would spend more time detailing the functionality between the DriverPass system and the DMV database for policy and exam information.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

It was important to listen to the different user's input and wishes because this helped to define the roles of the different types of users of the system, as well as making sure that the system would function in the way that the client desired. It is important to consider their wishes because this directly translates into client happiness, project success, and limits needed design revisions.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

In the future I would use a similar process. Listen to client needs, lay out the system requirements and functionaliity needs, schedule out the system production and begin the design process.
